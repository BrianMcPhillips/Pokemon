----- Pokedex -----

 - Pokedex is a front end, class based React application. This app uses SuperAgent, which is a small progressive client-side HTTP request library.
 - I made this app to practice my front-end React skills utilizing class based components, React-Router-Dom and making requests with super agent. 
 - The app provides a searchable interface using a filter component that adds or replaces query parameters when using a GET request to an API.
